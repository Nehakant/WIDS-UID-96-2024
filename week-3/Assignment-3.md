**WEEK-3 ASSIGNMENT**

* For this week you need to make a **Make Pneumonia or Normal classifier based on Chest X-Ray**.
* It will take time in training the model.
* You can download data from the given link:
```
LINK:-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
```

* To train it faster you can use **google colab GPU**, you can load the data in colab by running these commands
```
!pip install kaggle
!mkdir ~/.kaggle
!mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!kaggle datasets download -d paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
!unzip chest-xray-pneumonia.zip
```
> **Accuracy on testing data should be more than 60%**
