**Introduction to Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook widely used for interactive programming. It runs a local IPython kernel on your machine and launches in your web browser. These notebooks are also referred to as IPython notebooks and have a .ipynb extension instead of the traditional .py extension for Python files. All the assignments for this course are created in Jupyter notebooks, and you are expected to complete them within the notebook itself. Hence, it is important for you to get acquainted with Jupyter notebooks.
