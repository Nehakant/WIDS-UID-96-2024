**WEEK 1 BASICS OF PYHTON**

Let's start our project by learning the building blocks of Python, such as classes, functions, methods, libraries, and more. These concepts are highly useful. If you are new to this language, don't worry; Python is one of the easiest languages to learn and can be picked up in a short amount of time. 

Here are some tutorialsâ€”go through them and complete your Week 1 assignment.

**Introduction to Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook widely used for interactive programming. It runs a local IPython kernel on your machine and launches in your web browser. These notebooks are also referred to as IPython notebooks and have a .ipynb extension instead of the traditional .py extension for Python files. All the assignments for this course are created in Jupyter notebooks, and you are expected to complete them within the notebook itself. Hence, it is important for you to get acquainted with Jupyter notebooks.
