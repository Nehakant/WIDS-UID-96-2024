**Week 2: Linear and Logistic Regression Regression**

Before we begin developing full-fledged neural networks, we begin by understanding one of the most fundamental machine learning techniques- regression.

In this week, you will understand the logic behind linear and logistic regression, and how we harness mathematical and computational power to solve problems.

The resources for this week will be this online course on Supervised Learning on Coursera by Andrew NG. It is highly recommended that you complete all the video tutorials by the end of this week.
